## Greetings!

From urban ponds to remote lakes, people rely on aquatic systems for physical and cultural services. The availability and quality of water resources are dependent on what occurs "up-hill" or "up-stream" of these water bodies and so landscape level investigations are key.

I study aquatic systems to:\
\
1) Understand how the watershed context of lakes, ponds, and wetlands influence their structure and function and\
\
2) Explore how these systems are changing through time in response to changing land use, climate, and other drivers.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison in the [Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab](https://turnerlab.ibio.wisc.edu/) where I am studying carbon in urban ponds, wetland ecosystem services, and lake temporal dynamics in the Upper Midwest of the US with Dr. Monica Turner.
