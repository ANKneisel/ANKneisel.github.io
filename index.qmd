## Greetings!

From urban ponds to remote lakes, people rely on aquatic systems for physical and cultural services. I study aquatic systems to 1) understand how the landscape context of lakes, ponds, and wetlands influence their structure and function and 2) explore how these systems are changing through time.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison in the [Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab](turnerlab.bio.wisc.edu) where I am studying urban ponds, wetland ecosystem services, and lake temporal dynamics in the Upper Midwest of the US.
