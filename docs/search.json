I study aquatic systems to 1) understand how the landscape context of lakes, ponds, and wetlands influence their structure and function and 2) explore how these systems are changing through time.\nI am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison in the Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab where I am studying urban ponds, wetland ecosystem services, and lake temporal dynamics in the Upper Midwest of the US."
